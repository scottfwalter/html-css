          Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an
          utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended
          life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital
          watches are a pretty neat idea.

          This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of
          the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many
          solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were
          largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper,
          which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of
          paper that were unhappy.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of
          them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.

          There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly
          what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly
          disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and
          inexplicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is another theory which states that this has already happened.
        </p>
        <p><strong>The story so far:</strong></p>
        <p>In the beginning the Universe was created.</p>
        <p>
          This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a
          bad move.

          The regular early morning yell of horror was the sound of Arthur Dent
          waking up and suddenly remembering where he was.

          It wasn't just that the cave was cold, it wasn't just that it was damp
          and smelly. It was the fact that the cave was in the middle of
          Islington and there wasn't a bus due for two million years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time is the worst place, so to speak, to get lost in, as Arthur Dent
          could testify, having been lost in both time and space a good deal. At
          least being lost in space kept you busy.

          He was stranded in prehistoric Earth as the result of a complex
          sequence of events which had involved him being alternately blown up
          and insulted in more bizarre regions of the Galaxy than he ever dreamt
          existed, and though his life had now turned very, very, very quiet, he
          was still feeling jumpy.

          It doesn't necessarily do it in chronological order, though. The
          history of the Galaxy has got a little muddled, for a number of
          reasons: partly because those who are trying to keep track of it have
          got a little muddled, but also because some very muddling things have
          been happening anyway.

          One of the problems has to do with the speed of light and the
          difficulties involved in trying to exceed it. You can't. Nothing
          travels faster than the speed of light with the possible exception of
          bad news, which obeys its own special laws. The Hingefreel people of
          Arkintoofle Minor did try to build spaceships that were powered by bad
          news but they didn't work particularly well and were so extremely
          unwelcome whenever they arrived anywhere that there wasn't really any
          point in being there.
