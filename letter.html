        <h1>A New Chapter for Bartender</h1>
        <p>Dear Bartender Users,</p>
        <p>It's Ben Surtees, the original developer of Bartender. Twelve years ago, I embarked on a journey to create Bartender, a macOS app designed to help you manage your menu bar items. Over the years, it has been incredibly rewarding to see Bartender grow and become an essential tool for so many of you. Your support and feedback have been invaluable in shaping the app into what it is today.</p>
        <p>After the release of Bartender 5, I came to the realization that supporting all the users and maintaining the app at the high standard I expect and you deserve was too much for one person. It required a dedicated team that could provide continuous support, innovate, and keep up with the fast-evolving macOS landscape. This realization led me to make a difficult decision.</p>
        <p>Three months ago, I sold Bartender to Applause, a company with the resources and expertise to take the app to new heights. Applause shares my vision for Bartender and is committed to maintaining its core values while bringing in new features and improvements. I truly believe they are the right team to continue the journey and ensure Bartender remains a valuable tool for all of you.</p>
        <p>I understand that the transition hasn’t been entirely smooth. Recently, there was a change in the signing certificate for the app, and unfortunately, this change wasn’t communicated properly to you, our loyal users. I apologize for any confusion or concern this may have caused. Please rest assured that Bartender is signed by a valid Apple ID developer and notarized by Apple, which verifies the app to ensure it is free from malware. You can read more about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution" class="link">Apple's notarization process here</a>.</p>
        <p>To verify that this message is indeed from me, you can also see this post on the Surtees Studios website at <a href="https://surteesstudios.com/a-new-chapter/" class="link">https://www.surteesstudios.com</a>.</p>
        <p>I want to assure you that Applause is dedicated to maintaining the integrity and quality of Bartender. Their team is already hard at work on exciting updates and enhancements. I have full confidence in their ability to support and grow the app while staying true to its original mission.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your continued support and understanding during this transition. I am excited for the future of Bartender and look forward to seeing the new heights it will reach with Applause at the helm.</p>
